    """Multi layer perception classifier for multi class classification
    https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html#sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier

    Parameters
    ----------

    `hidden_layer_sizes` : tuple, length = n_layers - 2, default=(100,)
        The ith element represents the number of neurons in the ith
        hidden layer.

    `activation` : {'identity', 'logistic', 'tanh', 'relu'}, default='relu'
        Activation function for the hidden layer.
        - 'identity', no-op activation, useful to implement linear bottleneck,
          returns f(x) = x
        - 'logistic', the logistic sigmoid function,
          returns f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x)).
        - 'tanh', the hyperbolic tan function,
          returns f(x) = tanh(x).
        - 'relu', the rectified linear unit function,
          returns f(x) = max(0, x)

    `solver` : {'lbfgs', 'sgd', 'adam'}, default='adam'
        The solver for weight optimization.
        - 'lbfgs' is an optimizer in the family of quasi-Newton methods.
        - 'sgd' refers to stochastic gradient descent.
        - 'adam' refers to a stochastic gradient-based optimizer proposed
          by Kingma, Diederik, and Jimmy Ba
        Note: The default solver 'adam' works pretty well on relatively
        large datasets (with thousands of training samples or more) in terms of
        both training time and validation score.
        For small datasets, however, 'lbfgs' can converge faster and perform
        better.

    `alpha` : float, default=0.0001
        Strength of the L2 regularization term. The L2 regularization term
        is divided by the sample size when added to the loss.

    `batch_size` : int, default='auto'
        Size of minibatches for stochastic optimizers.
        If the solver is 'lbfgs', the classifier will not use minibatch.
        When set to "auto", `batch_size=min(200, n_samples)`.

    `learning_rate` : {'constant', 'invscaling', 'adaptive'}, default='adaptive'
        Learning rate schedule for weight updates.
        - 'constant' is a constant learning rate given by
          'learning_rate_init'.
        - 'invscaling' gradually decreases the learning rate at each
          time step 't' using an inverse scaling exponent of 'power_t'.
          effective_learning_rate = learning_rate_init / pow(t, power_t)
        - 'adaptive' keeps the learning rate constant to
          'learning_rate_init' as long as training loss keeps decreasing.
          Each time two consecutive epochs fail to decrease training loss by at
          least tol, or fail to increase validation score by at least tol if
          'early_stopping' is on, the current learning rate is divided by 5.
        Only used when ``solver='sgd'``.

    `learning_rate_init` : float, default=0.001
        The initial learning rate used. It controls the step-size
        in updating the weights. Only used when solver='sgd' or 'adam'.

    `power_t` : float, default=0.5
        The exponent for inverse scaling learning rate.
        It is used in updating effective learning rate when the learning_rate
        is set to 'invscaling'. Only used when solver='sgd'.

    `max_iter` : int, default=200
        Maximum number of iterations. The solver iterates until convergence
        (determined by 'tol') or this number of iterations. For stochastic
        solvers ('sgd', 'adam'), note that this determines the number of epochs
        (how many times each data point will be used), not the number of
        gradient steps.
